WFM Analytics Dashboard
1. Summary
Business Context:
GDC Consultants needs a central analytics dashboard to monitor workforce management, improve resource use, spot risks, and simplify decision-making using data from internal data sources.
Purpose:
Enable management and operations teams to visualize all critical company, employee, client, and project metrics, and leverage AI/ML for prediction and efficiency gains.

2. Data Sources & Integration
Data Sources:
Database tables: Project, Employee, Timesheet, Expense, Client, Leave, Task Assignment
REST APIs: For extracting structured data day-to-day and historic metrics.

Integration Approach:
Connect dashboard directly to WFM APIs for frequent auto-refreshes (live data)
Unified data model for dashboard visualizations

3. Dashboard Modules (Suggestions)
A. Company Overview
Visualizes:
Total Projects, Clients, Employees
Utilization rate % (hours vs. capacity)
Budget/spend, financial trends
Time filters (week/month/quarter)
Top KPIs at a glance
How it helps:
“Are we growing? Over/under staffed?”
Easy macro view for top management; quick insights for board/executive meetings
Wireframe Sketch:

System Data:
All counts, utilization, and trends from WFM APIs and database tables.
Example:
“Last quarter, utilization was only 65%; this month it’s 85% after new project onboarding.”

B. Project Analytics
Visualizes:
List of active, overdue, completed projects
Budget vs actual spend for each
Status (active, delayed, complete)
Project Manager leaderboard
Project timeline (Gantt)
Risks/alerts (overdue, over budget)
How it helps:
PMs spot which projects need help, allocate support, close gaps before clients complain.
Wireframe Sketch:

System Data:
Projects, budget, manager, start/end dates from data sources.
Example:
“PRJ-104 is 12 days late and 20% over budget. PM receives automated risk alert.”

C. Employee Analytics
Visualizes:
Timesheet submission % by staff
Overtime hours, workload heatmap
Leave tracking (calendar style)
Capacity gauge (over/underutilized)
How it helps:
HR sees risk of burnout, can prompt for leave, reward high performers, and balance workloads.
Wireframe Sketch:

System Data:
Timesheet records, leave logs, employee tables.
Example:
“David is working 54 hours a week and missed leave deadlines. HR notified automatically.”

D. Client Analytics
Visualizes:
Revenue per client, cost/profit breakdown
Number & status of projects/client
Satisfaction or repeat business indicators
Timeline of tasks/projects by client
How it helps:
Account managers target at-risk or high-value clients, allocate resources wisely.
Wireframe Sketch:

System Data:
Project <> client table joins, billing history, expense analytics.
Example:
“XYZ generates 40% of revenue, but their projects are repeatedly delayed and cost over budget.”

E. Timesheet & Expense Analytics (Optional)
Visualizes:
Submission rates (who is late/missing)
Expense anomalies (unusual claims, duplicate entries)
Approval bottlenecks (avg time to approve)
Top cost categories
How it helps:
Saves money, speeds up payments, flags errors/fraud, helps in audits.
System Data:
Timesheet submissions, expense logs, approval step records.
Example:
“Approvals for expenses now take 2 days instead of 9, saving time. $8k employee claim flagged for review.”

F. Workflow & Productivity (Optional)
Visualizes:
Team velocity chart (sprints, points)
Issue/blocker map (modules most affected)
Approval pipeline (average step times)
How it helps:
Managers see which processes slow business, focus improvement efforts.
System Data:
QA docs, retrospectives, development reports, approval workflow logs.
Example:
“Team velocity fell after new hire onboarding. QA bug map shows Projects module as most blocked.”

G. Predictive & AI Insights
Visualizes:
Delay risk % for projects (based on data patterns)
Anomaly alerts (expense, timesheet, project outliers)
ML model explainability (why flagged)
How it helps:
Let management be proactive.
Wireframe Sketch:

System Data:
All historical records, ML model outputs, risk/event logs.
Example:
“Project delay predicted lets PM adjust timeline.”

4. Data Security & Limitations
Security:
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) on dashboards, audit logs for data views, encryption in transit and at rest, tiered access for sensitive info.
Limitations:
Accurate analytics depend on full data submission, clean records, and API reliability. Predictive features need historic, labeled data for training and validation.
